== Description ==
EmbedMyPhotos allows you to embed an Instagram photo feed anywhere in your Wordpress site. 

This can take the form of a slideshow or a grid of photos. 

It is *very* simple to use! All you need to do is specify an Instagram user (which can be you or anyone else). Then define a couple of settings such as dimensions of the gallery or time between slides.  You can immediately preview your results in a dropdown window, and once you're happy, simply insert a "shortcode" in your Wordpress post or page. 

That's it!

== Installation ==
1. Upload the EmbedMyPhotos plugin to your blog and then Activate it.
2. A new entry will appear in your left hand Admin menu entitled "Instagram Feed". 
3. From here you can define a number of settings and preview how your feed will look. 
4. These settings are automatically saved with each click preview, so you can then immediately place the shortcode [EmbedMyPhotos] in any post or page of your Wordpress site.
5. That's it!

== Screenshots ==
1. Screenshot showing the \"Instagram Feed\" settings page.
2. Screenshot showing an example gallery in a dropdown screen
