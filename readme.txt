== Description ==
EmbedMyPhotos allows you to embed an Instagram photo feed anywhere in your Wordpress site. This can take the form of a slideshow or a grid of photos. It is *very* simple to use! All you need to do is specify an Instagram user (which can be you or anyone else). Then define a couple of settings such as dimensions of the gallery or time between slides.  You can immediately preview your results in a dropdown window, and once you\'re happy, simply insert a \"shortcode\" in your Wordpress post or page. That\'s it!

== Installation ==
Upload the EmbedMyPhotos plugin to your blog and then Activate it.  A new entry will appear in your left hand Admin menu entitled \"Instagram Feed\".  From here you can define a number of settings and preview how your feed will look. The settings are automatically saved with each preview, so you can then immediately place the shortcode [EmbedMyPhotos] in any post or page of your Wordpress site.

== Screenshots ==
1. Screenshot showing the \"Instagram Feed\" settings page.
2. Screenshot showing an example gallery in a dropdown screen

== Changelog ==

== Upgrade Notice ==
This is the first version, but we\'ve tested it thoroughly!  It\'s extremely simple to install and use, and doesn\'t require any registration or supplying special Instagram tokens. In fact we thoroughly recommend that you give it a try!
